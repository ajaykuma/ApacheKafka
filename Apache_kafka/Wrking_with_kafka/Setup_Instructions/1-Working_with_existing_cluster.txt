#all configurations for a kafka cluster are already done.
#configurations of zookeeper can be seen in '/usr/local/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg'
#configurations of kafka can be seen in '/usr/local/kafka/config/server.properties'
#configurations of kafka embedded zookeeper can be seen in '/usr/local/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties'

--we will use configs from /usr/local/kafka/sncluster

<OPTIONAL>
--Just some additional checks

#check in /tmp if there is zookeeper folder

hdu$sudo ls -all /tmp/zookeeper1
hdu$sudo ls -all /tmp/zookeeper2
hdu$sudo ls -all /tmp/zookeeper3

#if it has 'myid' file
hdu$sudo cat /tmp/zookeeper1/myid
hdu$sudo cat /tmp/zookeeper2/myid
hdu$sudo cat /tmp/zookeeper3/myid

#if there is no 'myid' file, we need to create this

hdu@n1$echo 1 > /tmp/zookeeper1/myid
hdu@n2$echo 2 > /tmp/zookeeper2/myid
hdu@n3$echo 3 > /tmp/zookeeper3/myid

#additionally you can check configs for kafka brokers
