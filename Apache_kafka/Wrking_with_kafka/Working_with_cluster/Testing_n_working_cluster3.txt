#Working with kafkanzk cluster
--------------------
Zookeeper acts as a external metadata management system for kafka. This creates multiple problems such as data duplication,
increased system complexity and also leads to additional java processes being used.
In order to run kafka without zookeeper, it can be run using Kafka Raft metadata mode ( KRaft ). 
In KRaft the kafka metadata information will be stored as a partition within kafka itself. 
There will be a KRaft Quorum of controller nodes which will be used to store the metadata. 
The metadata will be stored in an internal kafka topic @metadata .

This is available in an experimental mode in kafka 2.8.0

#Kafka cluster configuration
If you go to config/kraft folder inside the kafka home directory, you will see a file called server.properties.
This is a sample file which is provided by kafka, to show how kafka can be started without zookeeper.

node.id: This will act as the node Id in the cluster. This will help us identify which broker this is. 
It will also help us identify which kraft controller node this is.

process.roles: A node can act as a broker or controller or both. Here we are indicating that this node 
can be both a kafka broker and a kraft controller node.

inter.broker.listener.name: Here the broker listener name is set to PLAINTEXT

controller.listener.names: Here the controller listener name is set to CONTROLLER

listeners: Here we indicate that the broker will use port 9092 and the kraft controller will use port 9093

log.dirs: This is the log directory where kafka will store the data

listener.security.protocol.map: Here the connection security details are added

controller.quorum.voters: This is used to indicate all the kraft controllers which are available. 
Here we are indicating that we will have 3 kraft controller nodes running on ports 9093.

#Exploring the kafka metadata using metadata shell
Similar to zookeeper cli, there is a metadata shell 
provided by kafka so that we can read the data in the @metadata internal topic.

./bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh  --snapshot /tmp/server1/kraft-combined-logs/\@metadata-0/00000000000000000000.log

In order the list the brokers you can type ls brokers/
>> ls brokers/

In order to list the topics you can type ls topics/
>> ls topics/

In order to see the topic metadata you can type cat topics/kraft-test/0/data
>> cat topics/kraft-test/0/data

In order to find the controller leader node you can type cat metadataQuorum/leader
>> cat metadataQuorum/leader
