#Using AdminClient to administer/manage kafka cluster
if we don’t have access to the machine where it is deployed or we don’t have a tool like Yahoo Kafka Manager, 
we can use Apache Kafka’s AdminClient API for getting details about the topic or other details.

The AdminClient API supports managing and inspecting topics, brokers, acls, and other Kafka objects.
