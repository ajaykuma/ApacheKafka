Option1:
#import streamsapp as maven project and edit the broker config
#maven install
#take the jar file and place it in ur node of the cluster
#follow the instructions in 'Testing_n_working_cluster2' for standalone/cluster

Option2:
Just take the jar file 'streamsapp-0.0.n1-SNAPSHOT.jar' from github and use it
this is edited to connect to n1 as broker.
--if broker is on different host, we need to create the jar again
